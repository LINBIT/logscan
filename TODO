* Add signal handler that reports the current status (what logscan is still
  waiting for and how long the remaining timeout is).
* When scanning for multiple -y patterns at once, we only report the first
  occurrence; this doesn't always seem right.
* Right now, logscan duplicates regular expressions for each (logfile, posfile)
  pair; this can cause the same expression to be matched multiple times.
  Avoid that tracking which expresions have already been tried.
